# Bike Sharing Project

This repository contains the code and data used for the Bike Sharing Project. The project involves the analysis and prediction of bike-sharing usage patterns using geographical, demographical, and socio-economic data. Below is an overview of the repository's structure and the purpose of each folder and script.

## Data Files

The `Data Files` folder contains geographical and demographical data used in the project before the preprocessing stage.

## Final Data Files

The `Final Data Files` folder contains the data after preprocessing. This data has been cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis and model training.

## Other Scripts

The `Other Scripts` folder contains initial scripts used for experimentation and data analysis. Here is a breakdown of these scripts:

- `2019_bike_data_analyses.py`: This script loads the 2019 bike data and performs an initial analysis of the bike-sharing trips and station contents.
- `Bike_data_analyses.py`: This script delves deeper into the bike data, conducting further analysis to understand key characteristics.
- `Demographics.py`: This script analyzes the demographic and socio-economic factors related to bike sharing to understand their characteristics.
- `Experiments.py`: This script involves further experimentation using all available data and different machine learning models.
- `Socio-Demographics_Analyses.py`: This script provides additional analyses focusing on socio-demographic factors.

## Experiments

The `Experiments` file contains detailed information about the different iterations and experiments conducted during the project. It documents the various changes and adjustments made to the code and models.

## .py Scripts

The `.py` scripts (`Download_Bike_Data.py`, `Download_Bike_Points.py`, `Download_Demographics_data.py`) are used to download the raw data, preprocess it, and save the cleaned data locally for analysis.

## Running the Code

To replicate the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the required data using the provided `.py` scripts.
2. Access the `Bike-Sharing-Feature Selection-Final Script.ipynb` notebook. This notebook contains the complete code, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing steps, and results using various iterations.
3. Execute the notebook to observe the analysis and model training.

Please note that the notebook contains step-by-step explanations and documentation to help you understand each part of the project.
